Hide & Skin Trading Pty Ltd v Oceanic Meat Traders Ltd,"Hide & Skin (H&S) were exporters of animal products. The buyers of these products often paid for them up to six months after purchase and, to finance their ongoing business, H&S needed a third party to provide advance payment for goods sold but not yet paid for. Oceanic arranged the necessary financial facility for a period of two years. The facility was subject to termination on six monthsí notice. When Oceanic gave notice to terminate the facility, they argued that they were not obliged to give advance payments to H&S for money that would only be repaid by the purchasers after the facility had ended. H&S argued that they should be given advances right up to the end of the period of notice, even if purchasers made repayments up to six months thereafter.",Whose interpretation of the agreement was correct?,The agreement had the meaning suggested by H&S.,"Although interpreting the agreement in the way suggested by H&S might be disadvantageous to Oceanic, and might not be what Oceanic had subjectively intended, the courts construe the terms of a contract: first, by giving the words used their ordinary and natural meaning; second, by applying an objective (reasonable third party) test to ascertain the intended meaning of terms; third, by resolving ambiguities in commercial agreements by preferring alternatives that avoid commercial inconvenience or nonsense; and fourth, by basing the decision on the actual agreed terms in the contract rather than on any post-contractual behaviour of the parties. Applying these rules favoured the interpretation suggested by H&S.",1990,interpretation of terms
Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd,"The Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) bound itself by contract to pay the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) an annual licence fee for certain musical works performed on radio and television. The contract laid down a formula for the calculation of the fee. After some years, APRA contended that the agreement was intended to provide against depreciation in the value of money, and the formula as implemented was not doing so. It argued that the formula must be interpreted differently to ensure the constant value of the licence fee.",Was it open to the court to interpret the formula differently?,It is not the function of a court to attribute to the parties an intention for which their express words do not provide.,The words in which the formula was expressed were clear and gave rise to no ambiguity. The courts construe such agreements uncritically in accordance with the text.,1973,interpretation of terms
